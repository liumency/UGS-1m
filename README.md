# UGS-1m
[[project link]](https://liumency.github.io/UGS-1m/)

The project provides 1-meter UGS maps of 31 major cities in China (**UGS-1m**), which were generated by a deep learning (DL) framework. A **UGSet** and a **UGSNet** are included in the DL framework for large-scale and high-resolution UGS mapping.

 - **UGS-1m**: a fine-grained UGS map **product** of 31 major cities in China of 1 meter
 - **UGSet**: a large benchmark **dataset** to support and foster the UGS research
 - **UGSNet**: a fully convolutional **network** for fine-grained UGS mapping
