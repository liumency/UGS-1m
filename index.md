# UGS-1m
The project provideds 1-meter UGS maps of 34 major cities/areas in China (UGS-1m), which were generated by a deep learning (DL) framework. A UGSet and a UGSNet are inclued in the DL framework for large-scale and high-resolution UGS mapping.

 - UGS-1m: fine-grained UGS maps of 34 major cities/areas in China of 1 meter
 - UGSet: a large benchmark dataset to support and foster the UGS research
 - UGSNet: a fully convolutional network for fine-grained UGS mapping
