# UGS-1m
The project provideds 1-meter UGS maps of 34 major cities/areas in China (**UGS-1m**), which were generated by a deep learning (DL) framework. A **UGSet** and a **UGSNet** are included in the DL framework for large-scale and high-resolution UGS mapping.

 - **UGS-1m**: fine-grained UGS maps of 34 major cities/areas in China of 1 meter
 - **UGSet**: a large benchmark dataset to support and foster the UGS research
 - **UGSNet**: a fully convolutional network for fine-grained UGS mapping
