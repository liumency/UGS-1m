# UGS-1m
The project provideds 1-meter UGS maps of 34 major cities/areas in China (UGS-1m), which were generated by a deep learning (DL) framework. A UGSet and a UGSNet are inclued in the DL framework for large-scale and high-resolution UGS mapping.

 - UGS-1m: fine-grained UGS maps of 34 major cities/areas in China of 1 meter
 - UGSet: a large benchmark dataset to support and foster the UGS research
 - UGSNet: a fully convolutional network for fine-grained UGS mapping

## UGS-1m product 

The UGS-1m product provides the fine-grained UGS maps of 34 major cities/areas in China, which is generated based on a deep learning (DL) framework.

### Flowchart 
The main steps to obtain UGS-1m can be summarized as follows: 
- Firstly, the UGSNet will be pre-trained on the UGSet in order to get a good starting training point for the generator; 
- After pre-training on the UGSet, the discriminator is responsible to adapt the pre-trained UGSNet to different cities/areas through adversarial training;
- Finally, the UGS results of the 34 major cities/areas in China (UGS-1m) are obtained using 2,343 Google Earth images with a data frame of 7'30" in longitude and 5'00" in latitude, and a spatial resolution of nearly 1.1 meters. 


The UGS-1m product is now available at [zonodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6155516).
