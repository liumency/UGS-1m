# UGS-1m
The project provides 1-meter UGS maps of 34 major cities/areas in China (**UGS-1m**), which were generated by a deep learning (DL) framework. A **UGSet** and a **UGSNet** are included in the DL framework for large-scale and high-resolution UGS mapping.

 - **UGS-1m**: a fine-grained UGS map **product** of 34 major cities/areas in China of 1 meter
 - **UGSet**: a large benchmark **dataset** to support and foster the UGS research
 - **UGSNet**: a fully convolutional **network** for fine-grained UGS mapping

## UGS-1m product 

The UGS-1m product provides the fine-grained UGS maps of 34 major cities/areas in China, which is generated based on a deep learning (DL) framework. 

The product is now available at [**Zenodo**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6155516).
The Google Earth imagery used will be available at [**OneDrive**](https://mail2sysueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/liumx23_mail2_sysu_edu_cn/EuILVq8vbopKu_juqg4ams8BythT7i1Oe7X-9kQaVn-LAw?e=9aBqSq)
